# **SENThorizon – vCIO & Strategic Roadmap**

**Division:** SENTmsp (Services)  
**Architecture:** Business Intelligence & Forecasting  
**Status:** [GOLD_MASTER_READY]

## **1. Executive Summary**

SENThorizon acts as a "vCIO" (Virtual Chief Information Officer). It shifts the conversation from "Maintenance" to "Strategy". It visualizes IT budgets, forecasts technical debt ("The Budget Wall"), and manages the long-term Strategic Roadmap for the client.

## **2. Core Features**

### **2.1 Forecasting Engine**

- **Physics Engine:** Stochastic simulator that models budget needs based on adjustable levers:
  - **Inflation Rate**
  - **Revenue Growth**
  - **Headcount Growth**
  - **Market Conditions** (Bull/Bear/Stagnant)
- **Budget Wall:** Visualizes upcoming spikes in CapEx (e.g., "Server Refresh in June") to prevent surprise costs.

### **2.2 Strategic Roadmap**

- **Project Tracking:** Track high-level initiatives (e.g., "Core Switch Refresh", "Cloud Migration") with cost estimates and urgency (Critical/High/Medium/Low).
- **QBR Generator:** Generates Quarterly Business Review reports (PDF) incorporating the Health Score and Roadmap data.

### **2.3 Health Score**

- **Metric Aggregation:** Calculus of four pillars: Performance, Security, Lifecycle, and Efficiency. Gives the client a single "IT Grade" (0-100).

## **3. Integration with SENT Ecosystem**

- **SENTvault:** Stores the QBR reports generated by Horizon.
- **SENTstock:** Lifecycle data (EOL dates) from Stock inform the "Budget Wall" (e.g., "Servers expiring in Q3").
- **SENTpilot:** Completed Projects in Horizon can be converted into historical tickets in Pilot.

## **4. Use Case**

Used primarily by Account Managers and CIOs during quarterly planning sessions to justify IT spend and demonstrate value beyond "fixing broken printers."
