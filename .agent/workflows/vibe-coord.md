# Vibe Coding Coordination Workflow

// turbo-all

1. **Check & Shard:**
   - Read `/PROJECT_STATE.md`.
   - Identify if your task falls under `MSP`, `SEC`, or `ERP`.
   - Ensure the Domain is FREE.
2. **Claim:** Add your ID, Task, **Domain**, and Target Files to the 'Active Agent Registry'.
3. **Verify:** Ensure no other agent is working on the same files or conflicting modules.
4. **Code:** Perform the task with high velocity, ensuring cross-platform compatibility (Linux/Windows).
5. **Verify:** Run builds for both platforms before finishing.
6. **Sync:** If an architectural decision is made, update the 'Architectural Guardrails' section.
7. **Clear:** Upon completion, move your entry to 'Coordination Logs' and clear your claim.
